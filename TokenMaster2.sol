//   TokenMaster2 creates group shares, ERC20 token. It is a master contract for Ungravel ProxyToken.

//   Each Ungravel Group deploys its own group share token contract, a ProxyToken contract.

//   TokenMaster handles the distribution of shares, selling and buying within a group, sending and
//   transferring of group shares. In the beginning, group shares have only symbolic value, while their
//   distribution reflects the shareholder structure. Group shares are important to balance the

//   to provide liquidity to the group wallet and to incentivize member deposits to fund the group.
//   Later, group shares are offered for sale to external investors, therefore, groups may become valuable.

// The PrePaid Account (PPA) is a concept to fund a brand-new, self-managed ethereum address,
// without involving any third-party wallet, plug-in or bridge. A PPA is self-managed funding of 
// a fresh Ungravel working address to use Ungravel independently.

// Therefore, this PrePaidContract gets deployed, waiting for funding that instantly gets forwarded
// to the new address. PPA and address are created by user interaction using the Ungravel dApp.

// The PrePaid Account concept allows funding without importing any wallet file, pKey and
// without "connecting" third-party products to the dApp. We consider this a concept
// of enhencing overall security and improving independence. Practically, it renders third party 
// wallets obsolete while using Ungravel. All it needs, is a single transaction from anywhere,
// completely wallet-agnostic, independed from any account or wallet product.
// You may use a managed account from an exchange, s.a. kraken or coinbase, to fund the PPA.
// You my also use a self-custody account to fund the PPA.

// We believe that PPA simplifies dApp adoption and enhances user experience.
// Hint: Ungravel exports your PPA to a safe wallet file and stores the file locally on your computer.
// Ungravel allows to export and to import account information, using key files, aka wallet files.

// TokenMaster2 creates group shares, ERC20 token. It is a master contract for Ungravel ProxyToken.

// Each Ungravel Group deploys its own group share token contract, a ProxyToken contract.

// TokenMaster handles the distribution of shares, selling and buying within a group, sending and
// transferring group shares. In the beginning, group shares have only symbolic value, while their
// distribution reflects the shareholder structure. Group shares are important to balance the 
// structure of the group, they can be used to promote members, to incentivize member activity,
// to provide liquidity to the group wallet.

// Each Ungravel Group comes with a Voting Contract 
// that holds 100,000 shares and a ProxyToken contract, called "the reserve", holding another
// 100,000 group shares. Inside a group, members can buy and sell group shares, mainly to 
// make it as easy as possible to deposit funding for common affairs. Each group controls its 
// own funding and common assets in their GroupWallet, aka a multi-sig-wallet. 

// Group shares are the capital of each group, symbolic capital of informal groups IS capital.

// The very nature of informal team building is fragility and insecurity. Therefore, Ungravel
// stabilizes emerging teams by granting group shares, ENS domain names, a GroupWallet for 
// voting, a common group name and group description and the ENS group name itself.

// All assets belong to the group, they are common goods of each group, subject to majority vote.
// In case a group maturates and becomes valuable or renown, symbolic group shares may turn
// into convertible assets providing liquidity to the group.

// In this sense, group shares are needed from day one to enable Auction Funding and 
// investments into any group, in the future. Ungravel is a safe fund raising and
// investment tool that comes built into the DNA of each group from day one.

// Yet, any group may operate and work together without offering group shares at all.

// Ungravel is not preferring any type of group structure or use, hence, fund raising and 
// Funding Auctions are considered very powerful tools for every group, if needed.

// This TokenMaster contract also organizes PrePaid Accounts, PPA, a safe and straight-forward
// method to get started with a bit of funding without depending on third-party wallets.
// PrePaid Accounts offer an easy way to explore Ungravel without disclosing any account
// information. A simple transaction to the PPA is enough to enter Ungravel.
