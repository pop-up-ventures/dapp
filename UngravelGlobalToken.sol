// For Investors:
// Ungravel Global Shares transform VC investments into the nurturing of self-organizing, cell-like, on-chain economies.
//
// Ungravel Groups form economic cells, mushrooming an intertwined mesh of pop-up groups and spin-offs, autonomously.
// Investing becomes incentivizing "populations", instead of funding individual talent or certain qualified companies.

// Investors are betting on the entire on-chain economy, investing directly into user adoption, not talent, not company - nor product.
// Ungravel Society can populate different target chains, competing chains will want to co-invest, under pressure.
// 
// Infrastructure investors are buying user attention anyway, therefore, betting on a radically new idea seems quite reasonable.
// Ungravel re-invents ICOs - fundamentally modernized and aligned, applying innovative incentive design.

// For Users, Talents, Members:
// Co-workers get on-board with a 1-click-URL, no installation, no wallet, no expertise, no faucet, no hazzle, via desktop or mobile app.
//
// Group members receive group shares, a personal stake, a safe self-custody account, initial funding, stable coins, a unique EVM domain name, 
// such as: "vitalik.mygroup.stable", a built-in group share market, member voting, funding through auctions. No bank, no exchange, no DEX, no CEX,
// no issuer, no business lawyer, no notary, virtually no cost deploying an on-chain co-op, instantly running, worldwide accessible, always-on, 
// no borders, no customs, virtually unstoppable and extremely decentralized, running on 25+ EVM blockchains. No platform involved! Autonomous.
// All built on open protocols - ready for an agentic economy.


// For anyone else: "Ungravel Groups monetize group stability and member commitment."


// For Influencers: 
// Ungravel Groups capitalize on followers & communities, transforming any business on blockchain rails, in self-custody,
// free & independently, ommitting platforms.

// For beginners: 
// Ungravel Groups enable group building. Build any future organization, co-op or company, virtually for free.
// Ungravel Groups may become valuable, if needed, they may organize funding rounds by themselves.


//*******************************************
//** Ungravel Global Shares                **
//*******************************************

// Ungravel Groups may split and any group member may start her or his or its own group. Any member may also participate in more than one group.
// As Ungravel Society is growing, activities among groups become key.
// Groups that have completed an internal funding auction control their own common assets and their own liquidity.
//
// Any group may intend to invest in any other group. By simply "sending" a Letter-of-Intent, a LOI.
// Then, a group may vote again and decide to invest in any other group. Groups value other groups by investing and rising market cap.
// Investing in a group is merely a sale of group shares. Symbolic group shares have turned into convertible assets with an internal auction.
//
// Global Shares are required to structure incentives design:
//
// They offer liquidity to Ungravel Groups, paying out grants and converting acquired group shares into native liquidity, e.g. Ether.
// But where does liquidity actually come from? Ungravel Group Shares can be considered the main entry-point for VC investment on blockchain.
// As digital transformation progresses, it is transforming the very nature of seed-funding and incubating start-ups.
//
// Global Shares are for sale, resulting liquidity feeds 2 separate funds: One that keeps selling and buying of Global Shares liquid.
// The other one provides liquidity to Ungravel Groups, to a developing Ungravel Society as a whole.

// Ungravel does not introduce restrictions on who is who in this economy. Any VC investment may also go directly to any Ungravel Group.
// Betting on Ungravel Global Shares is betting on Ungravel Society, as a whole, on all groups at the same time.

// It may sound strange to traditional investors, but it comes with some interesting advantages:

// Thus, by investing into Ungravel Society, investors do not have to bet on certain teams or single entrepreneurs. They still may - if they want.
// Instead they may profit from the development of all Ungravel Groups at once. Investments in Global Shares nurture all groups at the same time.
//
// Groups organize themselves. Some are early-adopters, investment influencers, consultants or evangelists attracting more capital than others.
// They help to nurture and structure growth. With each transaction, each Funding Auction completed, market caps get adjusted.
// Therefore, each Ungravel Group has its own market cap that determines the price of Group Shares.

// But Ungravel Global keeps track of all transactions and combines the sum of all group activity into a global market cap.
// Ungravel Global Shares represent the current market cap of Ungravel Society. It is the sum of all individual market caps.

// Share price of Ungravel Global Shares is solely determined by market cap and the number of Global Shares issued.


//******************************************************
//** Is Ungravel Global Share yet another token sale? **
//******************************************************

// No. It re-invents token sale applying radically modernized incentives design.
//
// In the past, token sales, such as ICOs, often created highly priviliged investment opportunities.
// The general public or "retail investors" did pay a lot more than preferred investors, family and friends.
// That is one of the reasons why trust into ICOs eroded and user attention vanished. Despite scams and fraud.

// Ungravel Global Share does not organize an ICO. It is simply a fair market place for a structured investment opportunity.
// VC investors, investors, investing individuals or any small "retail" investor, they all have the same rights.
// No Global Shares "reserved", "locked-in" or "preferred". Ungravel Global Share is a single smart contract 
// for selling and buying global shares, according to liquidity and market cap. Transparently and open.
//
// In contrast to an ICO, share price solely derives from market cap. Market cap is the sum of group activities.
// Therefore, Global Shares are always "pegged" against real economic group activity. Comparable to GDP.
// The value of each group can be measured quite easily. It is the individual market cap that may only rise if a group 
// attracts internal or external funding.
//
// The overall value of Global Shares is easily measured as well: It is the total sum of all market caps. In this sense, 
// groups and society are based on real value, on actual economic activity. Consider Ungravel Society a cell-type economy on chain.
// A prototype of a blockchained economy where the distinction between user, group member and investor evaporates, it dissolves.


//******************************************************
//** What is comparable to Ungravel Global Shares?    **
//******************************************************

// Any stock holding company represents a certain value, its' market cap.
// It is the sum of all issued stock multiplied with the current stock price.
//
// Company shares are sold on stock markets, mainly through issuing banks,
// traders or fonds. Or the company itself by granting free stock to employees or management.
//
// At all time, current stock price gets adjusted while selling and buying stock on the market.
// At all time, stock price represents company valuation.
//
// A single number - combined with the total number of issued stock, determines the total value
// of the company. If selling stock to investors or banks, the company gets funding.
//
// Funding becomes working capital to create new products and revenue. Among other factors, 
// revenue determines share price and market cap. And so on...

// Ungravel Global Shares apply the same principles to a blockchained economy. It creates an autonomous 
// market place for selling and buying Global Shares. The issuing of Global Shares is 
// autonomous as well. It starts with 1b Global Shares and may rise to max. 10b automatically, unstoppable.
//
// It provides liquidity to Ungravel Groups, according to its own liquidity and group performance.
// It keeps Global Share market liquid, therefore, investors may sell Global Shares any time.

// Where are the differences?

// Economy on-chain is transforming stock-holding companies into self-issuing groups, it renders
// the issuing bank and the stock market obsolete, by "minting" and trading shares. Groups come with a built-in market place.
//
// Global Share economy even does not rely on CEXs or DEXs: Ungravel Global Shares are NOT dependent on centralized or 
// decentralized Exchanges! Ungravel comes with a built-in Global Share market as well. It does not need an issuer.
//
// It may require trade agents - but they will be Ungravel Groups. Or PR & promotion, they all will be Ungravel Groups.
//
// The main difference is that it is all new! Not done before.

// Is UUNS, Ungravel Unified Name Space, available on other EVM chains?
//
// Yes.
//
// UUNS unifies >25+ different EVM chains, it is most versatile to move USDC assets safely over CCTP, to build teams on stablecoin mainnet rails.
//
// UUNS is available at: ".usdc" | ".eth"    | ".base"  | ".hyper" | ".one"    | ".usdg" | ".monad" | ".ava" | ".uni"  | ".celo" |  ".sonic" |

// How VC investing transforms into the age of blockchains?

// Ungravel transforms VC investing into nurturing an autonomous, self-organizing, cell-like economy, on-chain.

// Ungravel Groups are economic cells, mushrooming intertwined meshes of pop-up groups and spin-offs, uncontrolled.
// Investing becomes incentivizing & feeding "populations" instead of funding talent or selected companies.

// Investors are betting on the entire "space", investing directly into user adoption, not individual talent, not company, nor product.
// "Ungravel Society" populates different EVM target chains. Competing chains will co-invest, fighting for users and for attention.

// In past years, investors subsidized nodes and chains quite heavily, neglecting the application stack & developer tools.
// Most chains will vanish and shut down, idling nodes will disappear, in fierce competition, the dApps will determine a chains' fate.

// Today, infrastructure investors are buying user attention anyway, therefore, betting on a radically new concept is reasonable.
// Ungravel re-invented ICOs - fundamentally modernized and aligned, by applying new incentives design.
// In contrast to an AirDrop, Ungravel Society is far more developed to engage users long-term.

// Today, the dApp runs in beta on 25+ different EVM-compatible chains, it is mobile-first and user-friendly.
// It does not require any third-party wallet or plug-in to be present or to be installed.
// The 1-Click-Onramp, e.g. by using a PayPal button to pay for this service, is live on major chains,
// it demonstrates that this powerful protocol allows to create PopUp Ventures on-the-fly, within seconds.
//
// Live tutorials "speak" to users directly, voice recognition is still experimental, but yet very engaging.
// The Ungravel team will organize an intensive technical workshop, demonstrating a complete tech stack, live,
// on 25+ chains, for the first time after 9 years of development, in Singapore or Hong-Kong, if you want.

    // It cannot be frozen. If you own UNGRAVELS, you are free to do what you want.
    // You are free to store them whereever you prefer. You remain in control.

    // This token contract does not impose any restrictions. Token cannot be frozen or blocked and cannot be taken away for any reason.
    // You may buy global shares from this contract, if the contract has enough shares in its supply and if you can pay 
    // the current price for the number of shares you want.

    // You may sell global shares to this contract, if the contract is liquid (e.g. ETH) and can pay out the current price, 
    // although, a fee of 1% applies.
    // Sample: You buy x global shares for 1 ETH, e.g. - if you sell x shares you will get back 0.99 ETH, the 0.01 ETH 
    // remains in the liquidity of this contract. (spread, provision)

    // Initially, 1,000,000,000 global shares are assigned to this token contract. It is called: the supply.
    // Only if the supply of this contract falls below 1,000,000,000 global shares, new global shares may be minted. 

    // The maximal number of global shares is 10,000,000,000 global shares. Minting new global shares is only 
    // possible, if the contract supply is below the initial threshold of 1,000,000,000 global shares.

    // Minting new global shares can be executed in steps of 1% of the remaining mintable reserve of global shares.
    //
    // It means: This contract - and nobody else either - can mint more than the maximal number of global shares.
    // Minting new global shares is performed automatically. Only if fresh global shares are needed, this contract is minting.

      // thorough consistency check that is very expensive. On the one hand, it has to double check all relevant
      // requirements, until a Grant gets payed. On the other hand, "Claiming and Receiving a Grant" is an 
      // important cornerstone of Ungravel Incentive Design. It is THE pre-requisite to convert group shares
      // into liquid currency, e.g. Ether. In other words, claimGlobalGrant() guarantees that any calling group
      // is actually entitled to claim a grant and later on will convert acquired group shares into Ether.

      // At a second glance, claimGlobalGrant() MUST be expensive on a purpose, this is intentionally, by design:
      //
      // It prohibits grant spammers and granting farms. It prohibits countless grants with fractional, tiny amounts,
      // therefore, it incentivizes that only valuable conversions will be executed and relevant grants will be claimed.
      // On-chain infrastructure that distributes value, global shares, scarce assets, VC-investment, will always be subject
      // of spammers and bonus farmers, grant farmers, trolls or all kind of bots that challenge the protocol.
      //
      // This is OK, as long as they pay 2.2m for gas, only to claim a grant!
      //
      // Ultimately, this follows one of the most important and basic principles of Ungravel Society: No bullshit required!
      // If Ungravel auctions, grants & asset conversions are substantial, relevant and mostly reach a certain, relevant value,
      // Ungravel Society will grow as a whole and become more valuable itself. Less bullshit pays off.
